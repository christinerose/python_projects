# python_projects

Created repo on 16 Feb 21 to commit Python projects. Working through Lynda, Codecademy, Treehouse, and others. Many practice assignments and homework from those places; however the following are Python projects written from concept to finish, working out the logic and execution on my own:
1. MadLibs.py
2. RockPaperScissors.py 
3. ROT.py
